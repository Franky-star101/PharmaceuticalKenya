# Pharmaceutical Sector in Kenya [(Here)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lXRyeuzep96DcrQXOu88PoHWLSm7fQ4_?usp=sharing)
## Overview
This dataset provides an overview of key indicators related to the pharmaceutical sector and public health across 47 counties in Kenya.This dataset can be useful for analyzing health service coverage, pharmaceutical availability, and regional healthcare challenges.
## Objectives
1. Comparing access to essential medicines across counties (e.g., pharmacy coverage and stock-outs).
2. Analyzing trends in the cost of medicines, and how that correlates with health insurance coverage.
3. Examining the relationship between government health spending and chronic illness prevalence (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
4. Identifying patterns in counterfeit drug cases and how they relate to import reliance.

### Steps
1. Import necessary library: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, numpy
2. EDA: adding a new column summarising the quatres
3. Data Visualization:elaborating correlations between various variables eggovernment health spending and chronic illness prevalence
4. Discussion and conclusion.
5. Presentation in ppt

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Kenyan pharmaceutical sector across 47 counties has highlighted significant disparities in access to essential medicines, healthcare infrastructure, and pharmaceutical services. While urban areas such as Nairobi and Mombasa have relatively well-established pharmaceutical networks, rural and marginalized regions still face considerable challenges, including limited access to pharmacies, inconsistent drug supplies, and insufficient healthcare professionals.

## Recommendation
To improve access to quality pharmaceutical services across all counties in Kenya, the following actions are recommended:
   1. Strengthen Pharmaceutical Supply Chains
   2. Encourage Public-Private Partnerships
   3. Capacity Building and Training
   4. Regulatory Framework and Policy Reforms
   5. Promote Local pharmaceutical manufacturing.
